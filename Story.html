            Hotpot is a traditional Chinese food beloved by a diverse range of people. Everyone sits around a simmering
            pot of broth and cooks different ingredients such as seasoned beef, vegetables and even fried dough bars. My
            hometown Chongqing is famous for its spicy hotpot, and the hotpot restaurants are always busy like a
            culinary carnival.

            Last weekend, I decided to invite my foreign friends to eat hotpot in a newly opened Chongqing restaurant in Chinatown.
            It was a chilly evening, the restaurant was crowded and we have to wait for a table for one hour. We didnâ€™t
            lose patience, because we have been warmed by the air which is full of the aroma of spices and chilli oil.

            We didn't wait too long for the ingredients and the broth after we got a table and placed the order.
            Different than the other kind of hotpot, Chongqing hotpot has a 9-squared frame to separate different
            ingredients in the pot. We placed sliced beef, tofu and other ingredients into the pot and waited for them
            to cook. The process is fun because you can clearly witness the change in the ingredients and decide when to
            retrieve them from the pot. Dipping into the sesame oil and other personalized spices, the morsel is good to
            eat.

            Hotpot not only stood out by its addictive taste but also by the atmosphere it created. During the waiting
            time, it is also a pleasant chance to chat with our friends. We drank our chilly canned beer and laughed
            loudly, enjoying our small moments of the weekend. We also had a friendly fight for the last piece of the
            spiced beef- by playing 'Rock Paper Scissors'.

            In our opinion, hotpot is not only an addictive food, but it is also a unique sign to represent our hometown.
            Further, it also brings a social and interactive experience that warms both your stomach and your heart.
